This is `xkeyboard-config from FreeDesktop.org`_, with the addition of my own
custom keyboard layout based on Workman and Programmer Dvorak for use with my
TEK-227_.  It expects the keyboard to have its builtin “ISO SE,ES,IT” mapping
enabled. The only differences with the original distribution are two additional
files: the `keyboard layout description`_ and this README. The `original README`_
can be found besides this one.
